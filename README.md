# MxStream
MxStream provides enhanced Java Stream functionality. Enhanced functionality includes;

* Parallel processing can be controlled with parallelism
* Asynchronous mapping allows processing data on multiple threads without loosing order
* Exception handling within stream
* Batching elements with optional timeouts
* Converting single-threaded stream to parallel stream using fan-out
* Sorting with a sliding window to control memory usage when sorting huge streams
* Standard stream operations including filtering, mapping, peeking and flat mapping with optional supplier pattern
* Creating stream from additional sources including standard Java streams and iterators.

These features enhance the flexibility and performance of stream processing for large data sets and complex operations.
